In the vastest part of space
Where silence grows, I move in grace
but I am deadly as they come
Yes, I'm the one who justice call
When all hope seems to fall apart
So here we go again
I'm crossing Zebes' stratosphere
The acid rain comes pouring down
and dark's the way that guides my feet
Just choose your side, you're friend or foe
Answer fast or you'll be gone

I'm dangerous
And watching over you
I'm fire
but in the end I'm only human
Mysterious
Might be the sweetest dream
or nightmare
but in the end I'm only human

The sun is going down again,
or not, down here it's hard to tell
I'm seven miles below the surface, alone against this world
Haven't slept for days, I'll get my sleep
when I've put your life to rest

I'm dangerous
And watching over you
I'm fire
but in the end I'm only human
Mysterious
Might be the sweetest dream
or nightmare
but in the end I'm only human

I'm dangerous
And watching over you
I'm fire
but in the end I'm only human
Mysterious
Might be the sweetest dream
or nightmare
but in the end I'm only human",,4:33,

Little Mac is a boxing man
And he's been training a bunch
Jumping ropes, smashing sand bags
Improving his vicious star punch

He might not be very tall
He might not reach you at all
But one punch, and you will fall!

Doc Louis is a coaching man
A famous hard hitter from '54
He's retired now, training Little Mac
Until a new champion is born

He strengthens Mac's psyche and strike
I don't think he stole that bike
A chocolate bar's what he'd like

Spotlights on and a round of applause
For the left corner boxer in his green gloves and shorts
Like a butterfly he'll float and like a bee he will sting
He'll down his challengers so hard they won't hear the bell ring
This time he'll wear the gloves to take out the trash
Now he's playing with power in Super Smash

PUNCH OUT!
By his master hands you'll be
KNOCKED OUT!
Before you get a chance to see
LIGHTS OUT!
Your face is history
PUNCH OUT!

Little Mac is a little man
But now he's going big with the champion fight
With Doc by his side, will his dream come true?
Will the title and belt be his tonight?

He will now end your career
You'll know the end is near
When you're punched through the atmosphere

FIGHT!
We've got nothing better to do
FIGHT!
If you fight me then I'll fight you
FIGHT!
This champion title is not for two
Fighting is all that I ever learnt to do

Now Little Mac is the champion, man
Still not so tall but very proud
But in Super Smash, his length is something good
Hitting under the belt is allowed

He might not be very tall
He might not reach you at all
But one punch, and you will fall!

Spotlights on and a round of applause
For the left corner boxer in his green gloves and shorts
Like a butterfly he'll float and like a bee he will sting
He'll down his challengers so hard they won't hear the bell ring
This time he'll wear the gloves to take out the trash
Now he's playing with power in Super Smash

PUNCH OUT!
By his master hands you'll be
KNOCKED OUT!
Before you get a chance to see
LIGHTS OUT!
Your face is history
PUNCH OUT!",,3:50,

Lyrics:

What a thrill
With darkness and silence through the night
What a thrill
I'm searching and I'll melt into you
What a fear in my heart
But you're so supreme!

I give my life, not for honor, but for you (Snake Eater)
In my time, there'll be no one else
Crime, it's the way I fly to you (Snake Eater)
I'm still in a dream, Snake Eater

Someday you go through the rain
And someday you feed on a tree frog
This ordeal, the trial to survive
For the day we see new light

I give my life, not for honor, but for you (Snake Eater)
In my time, there'll be no one else
Crime, it's the way I fly to you (Snake Eater)
I'm still in a dream, Snake Eater
I'm still in a dream, Snake Eater
